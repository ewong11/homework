I think all cases are solvable except 3X3 because I tested each one out and managed to find solutions.
there are multiple solutions for each case, and they can be found through rotations and reflections
distinct solutions will have to be found manually by guess and check
some placements can be found by moving as a knight would - 2 across + 1 down or up
each row and column will only have one queen
