-it would have been interesting to live in the past - to not understand anything and be in awe of natural phenomena.
this would have kindled our imagination of the world - a sort of ignorance is bliss kind of thing
-the coffeehouse is like today's internet
everyone is equal in a way and we can share our ideas
-who knew that it only took a couple of people (geniuses) that changed our perception of the world, compared to the number of
humans in history.
-Halley and Newton needed each other. Newton was the brains, and Halley was the PR guy. We never hear about Halley contributions
to the publication of Newton's Principia, but had Halley not been so determined to publsh it, who knows how different the world
would have been?
-i didnt know space exploration had its roots in Newton's ideas
-Newton was a real scholar that changed humanity's ways of thinking
